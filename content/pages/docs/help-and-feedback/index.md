## Help & Feedback

While every effort will be made to assist you as quick as possible, please be aware upfront that our bandwidth is limited.

  <strong>Community Help</strong> 
  While HMDA Hero does not have a community resource today to turn to for help, we'd be interested to hear if such a resource would be beneficial in your case. Please let us know if you would benefit from a community driven resource.
