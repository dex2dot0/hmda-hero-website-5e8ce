## NA Button

Most data entry fields will have validation that provides feedback as soon as data is entered or loaded. For example, the Loan Amount field shown below is highlighted in red because the input box will only accept numerical characters:

![](/images/Loan%20Amount%20Error.png)



When the value is changed to numeric characters, the red highlight goes away and is instead replaced with a green underline to indicate that the input is valid:

![](/images/Loan%20Amount%20Valid.png)
