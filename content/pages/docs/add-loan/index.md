Manually adding a loan record to the LAR is never a simple task but sometimes it is unfortunately necessary. Maybe your loan system is still talking dial-up but maybe that is of course reliably for the last 15 years. It's proved its worth and been a loyal companion so you're happy to keep it around. We get it.

Come HMDA time though, you might be singing a different praise and a tune that is more fit for a sailor. That's where HMDA Hero comes in.

**Add Loan**

To get started, make sure you have already followed our instructions in the Get Started section.

Next, you'll want to launch the Add Loan tool from the HMDA Hero menu:

The HMDA Hero Add Loan tool will pop up on the right of your spreadsheet and provide all the fields you need so you can quickly start entering your loan record manually. Moreover, it will help provide immediate feedback on the type of data you can enter for each field as well as regulatory references to ensure you know exactly how to report the data for the loan!

  If you already have loans that are included in a pipe delimited HMDA LAR format and need to import them, please see our documentation on importing.
