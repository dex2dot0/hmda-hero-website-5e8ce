Manually adding a loan record to the LAR is never a simple task but sometimes it is unfortunately necessary. Maybe your loan system is still talking dial-up but of course reliably for the last 15 years. It's proved its worth and been a loyal companion so you're happy to keep it around. We get it. 

Come HMDA time though, you might be singing a different praise and a tune that is more fit for a sailor.
