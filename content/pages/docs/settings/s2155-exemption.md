## S2155 Exemption Setting

If your organization qualifies for an S2155 exemption, you can optionally apply this setting to change the behavior of HMDA Hero.

![](/images/S2155ExemptionSetting.png)

This is completely optional as it will hide all exempt fields from input in case you do not want to have to input these fields. When you add or edit a loan with this setting applied, exempt eligible fields will be marked as exempt automatically and will not be shown in the HMDA Hero input screens. As a result, this is not necessarily recommended as you are masking data that you may otherwise want to enter for organizational and record keeping purposes. HMDA Hero has an export file option that will allow you to achieve the same result that is discussed more in the Export Loan Records section of these docs.
