## S2155 Exemption Setting

If your organization qualifies for an S2155 exemption, you can optionally apply this setting to change the behavior of HMDA Hero.

![](/images/S2155ExemptionSetting.png)

This is completely optional as it will hide all exempt fields from input and automatically mark those fields as an exemption code. By using this setting, when you add or edit a loan, exempt eligible fields will be marked as exempt and not shown in the HMDA Hero input screens. As a result, this is not necessarily recommended as you are masking data that you may otherwise want to enter for organizational purposes. HMDA Hero has an export file option that will allow you to achieve the same result
