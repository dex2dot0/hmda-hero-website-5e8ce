## Microsoft Excel

You will need Microsoft Excel in order to use HMDA Hero. All Microsoft Excel versions are supported including Desktop version and Web browser based versions. 

## CFPB LAR Formatting Tool

HMDA Hero is designed to add rich functionality to the CFPB's [LAR Formatting Tool](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/tools/lar-formatting).
