We would be remiss without giving proper and due credit to the great people at [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/) for the templating engine running this site. This site is built upon their [Libris Template ](https://themes.stackbit.com/demos/libris/)and has made it super easy to deploy a fast & performant site that is easy to setup through their site builder. With Stackbit, there is no need for someone to be a developer, though you can be. We've found it easy to get an awesome site like this bootstrapped in no time and that is very deserving of some recognition and certainly our full appreciation! Full disclosure, Stackbit is not a sponsor or affiliate in any way and we are saying this because it really is awesome and deserving of the credit being given!
