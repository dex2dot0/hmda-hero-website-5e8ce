With HMDA Hero you can easily import loan records from as many CFPB pipe delimited files as you need. As a result, you can combine the loan records across multiple loan systems in to a single HMDA LAR for filing purposes.

***

To get started, make sure you have already followed our instructions in the Get Started section.

### Launch the Import tool from the HMDA Hero menu

### Import File Format

HMDA Hero is able to import data from pipe delimited text files that meet the CFPB's formatting guidelines. You can check whether your import file meets these guidelines by using the [CFPB's File Format Verification Tool](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/tools/file-format-verification).

Import Options

With the import tool launched you can select a file for import by either clicking in the Choose file box or clicking on the Browse button. Either option will bring up the same file selection window.

##### All Data Import

If you select and import a file with the All Data option selected, the organization data contained on the first line of the import file will also be imported.

##### Loan Data Only

If you select and import a file with the Loan Data Only option selected, organization data will not be imported.
